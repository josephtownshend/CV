I am an early career full stack software developer and recent graduate of Makers Academy in London. My background is in graphic design, print and the visual arts in which I studied for 6 years. I ran two successful design and print studios before finally deciding to take my love of learning into the world of tech, and I haven't looked back. I am a passionate creative problem solver and always on the look out for new processes to help build workarounds for troublesome situations.

## Skills

#### This Skill

- Mentoring
  - During my time at Makers Academy I mentored two students through the beginings of their coding journey. This was a great challenge for me, and an oppertunity to coach students through areas that I too had struggled with. It also shon a light on my own progress and how teaching others can help instill that knowledge in yourself.
  
- Creative Problem Solving
  - During my time running <a href="https://www.instagram.com/houseworkpress/">Housework(Press)</a> I operated a Riso MZ970 printer as our main means of production. The Riso is a large grey japanese printer that runs on outdated software, spare parts and constant maintenance. The machine is very idiosyncratic so subsequently I spent a great deal of time not only troubleshooting the printer itself but creating solutions to realise complex artwork, this is something that I became very adept at and also thoroughly enjoyed.

## Experience

*Mentor*

CoderDojo is a free, global and volunteer led initiative for young people to learn programming. We use Blockly and Scratch, both of which are block-based visual programming languages, developed by Google and MIT respectively. It has been a great oppertunity to learn something new and try to teach that skill to students with little to no experience.

Since embarking on my graphic design eductaion I have continuously worked as a freelance and selfemployed graphic designer.
