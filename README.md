<p align="center">I am an early career full stack software developer and recent graduate of Makers Academy in London. My background is in graphic design, print and the visual arts, which I studied for 6 years. I then ran two successful design and print studios before finally deciding to take my love of learning into the world of tech, and I haven't looked back. I am a passionate creative problem solver and always on the look out for new processes to help build workarounds for troublesome situations.</p>

## Skills

- A Genuine Thirst For Knowledge
  - Since embarking on my coding journey I have discovered a real drive to understand the processes and technologies we use as part of our daily practice on a very deep level. Rather than grappling with the newest tech trends, I find myself much more drawn towards breaking down knowledge into its most rudimentary core components. I have found that in acquiring a deeper level of understanding I am able to much more readily implement my learning into everyday tasks.

- Mentoring & Skill Sharing
  - During my time at Makers Academy I mentored two students through the initial stages of their coding journey. This was a great challenge for me, and an opportunity to coach students through areas that I too had struggled with. It also shone a light on my own progress and how teaching others can be a valuable way to deepen that knowledge and understanding. I wrote a blog about this experience, [it's avaliable to read here](https://medium.com/@joetownshend1/learning-through-the-lens-of-mentorship-631b2b834df0).
  
- Creative Problem Solving
  - During my time running <a href="https://www.instagram.com/houseworkpress/">Housework(Press)</a> I operated a Riso MZ970 printer as our main means of production. The Riso is a large grey Japanese printer that runs on outdated software, spare parts and constant maintenance. The machine is very idiosyncratic so subsequently I spent a great deal of time not only troubleshooting the printer itself but also creating solutions to realise complex artwork, this is something that I became adept at and also thoroughly enjoyed.

## Interests

* Motivated climber and active member of Makers Climbing & Tech Climbing London.
* Spending time outdoors (ideally up a mountain).
* Vegan cooking, and a quest to find great meat alternatives.
* Trying to write [blog posts](https://github.com/josephtownshend/Blog).
