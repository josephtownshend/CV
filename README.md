## Joseph Townshend

I am an early career full stack software developer and recent graduate of Makers Academy in London. My background is in graphic design, print and the visual arts, which I studied for 6 years. I then ran two successful design and print studios before finally deciding to take my love of learning into the world of tech, and I haven't looked back. I am a passionate creative problem solver and always on the look out for new processes to help build workarounds for troublesome situations.

## Skills

- A Genuine Thirst For Knowledge
  - Since embarking on my coding journey I have discovered a real drive to understand the processes and technologies we use as part of our daily practice on a very deep level. Rather than grappling with the newest tech trends, I find myself much more drawn towards breaking down knowledge into its most rudimentary core components. I have found that in acquiring a deeper level of understanding I am able to much more readily implement my learning into everyday tasks.

- Mentoring & Skill Sharing
  - During my time at Makers Academy I mentored two students through the initial stages of their coding journey. This was a great challenge for me, and an opportunity to coach students through areas that I too had struggled with. It also shone a light on my own progress and how teaching others can be a valuable way to deepen that knowledge and understanding. I wrote a blog post about my experience which is avaliable to read [here](https://github.com/josephtownshend/Blog/blob/master/Learning%20Thourgh%20The%20Lens%20of%20Metorship.md).
  
- Creative Problem Solving
  - During my time running <a href="https://www.instagram.com/houseworkpress/">Housework(Press)</a> I operated a Riso MZ970 printer as our main means of production. The Riso is a large grey Japanese printer that runs on outdated software, spare parts and constant maintenance. The machine is very idiosyncratic so subsequently I spent a great deal of time not only troubleshooting the printer itself but also creating solutions to realise complex artwork, this is something that I became adept at and also thoroughly enjoyed.

## Experience

**<a href="https://coderdojo.com/" target="blank">CoderDojo</a>** (2019)    
*Mentor*

CoderDojo is a free, global and volunteer led initiative for young people to learn programming. We use Blockly and Scratch, both of which are block-based visual programming languages, developed by Google and MIT respectively. It has been a great opportunity to learn something new and try to teach that skill to students with little to no experience. 

**<a href="http://www.housework.press" target="blank">Housework(Press)</a>** (2016 –– 2019)    
*Founder*

Housework(Press) was as a South East London based *Risograph* print press and publishing company dedicated to realising experimental and process-driven design and art. Over 3 years of operation, Housework(Press) worked on more than 200 jobs from clients such as *The Design Museum, The Serpentine, Studio Moross, The British Fashion Council, Architectural Association* and *The Royal College of Art.*

**<a href="http://www.joe-t.com" target="blank">Joseph Townshend Studio</a>** (2010 –– 2019)   
*Founder*  

Since embarking on my graphic design education I have continuously worked as a freelance and self-employed graphic designer. I have a key interest in print design and in combination with my experience at Housework(Press) I have since become well known for my playful, vibrant Risograph poster work and book design. Recent clients include *Black Tower Projects, Kestle Barton Gallery,* and *Newlyn Art Gallery*

**<a href="http://www.jotta.com" target="blank">Jotta</a>** (2013 –– 2014)\
*Freelance Graphic Designer & Creative*

During my time at Jotta I worked on multiple projects for clients including *Heineken, Samsung, Intel* and *Pernod Ricard*. I worked predominantly as a creative, which included roles such as set design and build as well as curating events and installations. Along side my creative work I also produced the in-house graphic design throughout that period.
